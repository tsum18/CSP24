    <em><h1>Project 1:</h1>
	<img src="./fish.png" height="500">
	<h1>This was our first CSP project, where we created a maze using Pygame. In this game, the fish goes through a maze to reach the treasure at the end. There is also a time limit of 30 seconds before the game freezes with a “game over”.

</h1>

    <h1>Project 2:</h1>
     <img src="./project_2.png" height="500">
      <br>
<h1>This was our second CSP project, where we created a Halloween "pumpkin catcher" game. The player is prompted in the terminal to memorize the order that the pumpkins drop in, then click the corresponding number keys to make them drop into the basket.</h1>
    <h1>Project 3:</h1>
	<img src="./Capture.PNG" height="500">
<h1>This was our third CSP project, where we created a Valentine's Day e-card of a singing hippo. The recipient is asked to put in their name, and choose between two songs ("Baby" or "Fly Me To The Moon). The hippo then sings to them the song of their choosing and gives them a personalized message.</h1>     
      <br>
	      
    <h1>Project 4:</h1>
     <img src="./fishtank.JPG" height= "500">
<h1> This was our fourth CSP project, where we tested the security of a fish tank that had a security breach. By checking the data and logs of the fish tank, we identified errors in parameters and values, fixing them so the fish tank could perform its manual check correctly.

    <h1>Project 5:</h1>
<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1096069566/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<h1> This was our fifth CSP project, where we created a parody of "Flappy Bird", where instead of a bird you control people and try to make it not hit the barriers. The sprite changes every time the player clicks the space bar or left-clicks the mouse, and there are multuple backgrounds.</h1>

    <h1>Project 6:</h1>
<img src="./gui.png" height="500"> 
	<h1> This was our sixth CSP project, where we created a GUI. The user inputs a link to the website and the GUI shows how quick the website loads and works, then they can save the information to their computer.</h1>
   <h1> Project 7: </h1>
	<img src="./forest.png" height="500">
<h1> This is our seventh CSP Project, where we needed to figure out which region the rover is located. By organizing data and graphing it, we hypothesize that the rover is in the Inland Forest region. This is because Mr. Dunlea gave us a hint that the data was in a smooth region, and the inland forest had the smoothest line for change in temperature. </h1>
